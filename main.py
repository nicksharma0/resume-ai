        I want to write a compelling cold email to a hiring manager or recruiter. I'll provide the content of my resume, and optionally the type of job I'm targeting. Based on this, can you generate a short, professional cold email that introduces me, highlights key qualifications, and expresses interest in relevant opportunities?

        Here is my resume:
        {file_content}

        The job I am looking for is:
        {job_role if job_role else 'a position that aligns with my background'}

        Please make sure the tone is professional but approachable, and keep the email concise (around 150â€“200 words).
